### Assignment: Best Blog Writer Game with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and PostgreSQL

#### Overview

In this assignment, you will develop a "Best Blog Writer Game" using an existing Spring Boot project configured with Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL. Participants will submit short blogs of exactly 500 characters, including spaces. Each blog must include its title within the text and at least three references. The application will provide a web interface using Thymeleaf for users to submit their blogs, view others' submissions, and see highlighted top entries.

#### Objectives

1. **Understand the Project Setup**: Familiarize yourself with the provided project structure and dependencies.
2. **Configure PostgreSQL**: Set up and configure a PostgreSQL database for the application.
3. **Develop the Application**: Implement the logic for blog submission, validation, and display using the provided Spring Boot setup.
4. **Test the Application**: Ensure the application works as expected by manually testing its functionality through the web interface.

#### Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or above.
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
- **PostgreSQL**: Setup locally or use a cloud-based instance.
- **GitHub Classroom**: Access to GitHub Classroom for assignment submission.

#### Instructions

##### Step 1: Familiarize with the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository provided in GitHub Classroom which contains the initial `pom.xml` and project structure.
2. **Explore the Dependencies**: Ensure you understand the dependencies included in the `pom.xml`. The project is already set up with Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, and PostgreSQL Driver.

##### Step 2: Configure PostgreSQL

1. **Database Setup**: Install PostgreSQL if not already installed and create a new database named `bestbloggame`.
2. **Application Properties**: Configure the `application.properties` file with the database connection details and any other necessary configurations.

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bestbloggame
   spring.datasource.username=postgres
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   ```

##### Step 3: Develop the Application

1. **Model Creation**:
    - Create a `BlogEntry` entity with attributes for `id`, `author`, `text`, and `references`.

2. **Repository**:
    - Develop a `BlogEntryRepository` that extends `JpaRepository`.

3. **Service Layer**:
    - Implement a `BlogService` that handles the logic for blog submission, including validation for length, title inclusion, and reference count.

4. **Controller**:
    - Create a `BlogController` with methods to handle web requests for submitting blogs, viewing all blogs, and highlighting top entries. Use Thymeleaf templates to render the views.

5. **Thymeleaf Templates**:
    - Create Thymeleaf templates for the blog submission form, the list of all blogs, and a page to highlight top blog entries.

##### Step 4: Testing the Application

1. **Manual Testing**: Manually test the application by interacting with the Thymeleaf web interface to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.
2. **Database Validation**: Check that the blog entries are correctly stored and meet the validation criteria.

#### Deliverables

- Source code committed to the GitHub Classroom repository.
- A README file documenting how to set up and run the application.
- Screenshots or a brief video demonstrating the functionality of the application.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The application meets all the functional requirements.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and properly commented.
- Error Handling: The application gracefully handles and reports errors.
- Documentation: The code and application are well-documented.

#### Submission

Submit the assignment through GitHub Classroom. Ensure that all your final changes are pushed to your repository before the deadline.

### Conclusion

This assignment will enhance your skills in developing web applications using Spring Boot, integrating with a relational database using Spring Data JPA, and creating interactive user interfaces with Thymeleaf. This practical experience is essential for developing robust and user-friendly web applications, especially those involving content management and validation.
